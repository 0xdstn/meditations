# Meditations

I have used both the physical 5 Minute Journal and the official app on and off for a while now, but they both feel like overkill for me personally.

I don't really need a historical record or a physical book to sit on my shelf. Looking later isn't really the point, the point is the act of writing down what you're grateful for and reflecting on your day.

I decided to create this simple app which emulates the 5 Minute Journal app, but resets each day. No history is saved.

This site is a PWA, meaning you can install it to your device in Android and it will look and act like a native application.
